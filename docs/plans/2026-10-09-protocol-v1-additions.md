# Protocol v1 additions — design of record (2026-10-09)

This design covers the C-series protocol work in [the spec-completion plan](2026-10-09-spec-completion-plan.md). The Core protocol (`core/crates/sandpane-protocol`, `schemas/`) is designed once here. Each feature then lands as its own commit against this document, with the schema, Core and all three clients updated **together**. That follows AGENTS.md Code Review rule 8 and the `core-protocol` skill.

## 1. Compatibility rules (why the surface looks like this)

A read-only investigation of the shipped clients found the following (scratch notes; summarized here):

| Change | JetBrains | VS Code | Desktop |
|---|---|---|---|
| New optional field on a params/result object | tolerated (`ignoreUnknownKeys`) | tolerated (cast) | tolerated (known-key decoders) |
| New RPC method | tolerated; call refused client-side until allowlisted | same | same |
| New value in `TaskStatus` / `ErrorCode` / `FileChangeStatus` / `WorkspaceMode` | **hard-fails whole calls** (`task.list`, `git.review`, `sandbox.list`; `conversation.send` fails *after* Core applied it) | degrades visibly | **hard-fails whole calls** (desktop tolerance fix in progress) |
| `PROTOCOL_VERSION` bump | Core rejects `v≠1` **before** dispatch, including `system.probe`, so JetBrains loops in `Unavailable` forever and desktop shows "unreachable" | ignored | "unreachable" |

**Therefore:**

1. **`PROTOCOL_VERSION` stays `1`. Every change below is additive:** new methods, new optional request fields, and new response fields that are absent-tolerant (`#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = …)]`).
2. **No new values in the four strict enums.** Every spec-required error code (`NOT_INSTALLED`, `DAEMON_DOWN`, `UNSUPPORTED_SBX_VERSION`, `PROVIDER_AUTH_REQUIRED`, `CONFLICT`, `TASK_INTERRUPTED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, `VALIDATION_FAILED`, plus `NOT_FOUND` and `INTERNAL`) already exists. New outcomes are expressed as new **fields** or new **string-valued fields on new objects**, never as new enum members. If a new enum value ever becomes unavoidable, a separate client-tolerance commit must land first in every client.
3. **Clients gate every new call on `system.probe`'s `methods` advertisement.** If the method is not advertised, the action is shown as visibly unsupported, never hidden behind a fake success.
4. **Each method addition updates every pinned list in the same commit.** The rows for "Adding an RPC method" in the investigation list them:
   - Rust `Method` (`ALL`, `parse`, `as_str`, the `EXPECTED` test) and the service dispatch;
   - `schemas/rpc-request.schema.json`;
   - JetBrains `CoreMethods` / `ProtocolDriftGuardTest` / `CoreClientFramingTest`;
   - VS Code `CORE_METHODS` / `protocolWire.test.ts` / `commands.test.ts` / `live-core-check.mjs`;
   - desktop `METHODS` / `protocol-drift.test.ts` / `protocol.test.ts` / `ipc_client.rs` (`replay_safe`, `proxy_deadline_ms`, the count test) / `REPLAY_SAFE_METHODS` / `METHOD_TIMEOUT_MS`.
5. **Whole-repo gate on every protocol commit:**
   - Core gates and `make schema-drift`;
   - `make desktop-check` (desktop compiles `sandpane-protocol` by path);
   - VS Code `typecheck`, `test` and the live check;
   - JetBrains `test --rerun buildPlugin`.

## 2. Destructive-action confirmation (shared pattern)

The specs require server-side confirmation for destructive actions:

- 02 §5: "never delete a sandbox created outside Sandpane without an explicit user confirmation";
- 02 §4: separate cancel, stop sandbox, archive chat and delete project.

Client-side dialogs alone are not enough, because any same-user process can speak the socket. **Two-step confirmation token** — a server-enforced two-step confirmation bound to the target identity. It is **not** proof of human presence: a malicious same-user process (the specs/06 §3 attacker) can call step 1 and replay the token into step 2, and the socket's same-user authentication cannot tell it apart from a client UI. It stops single accidental or stale requests and binds the action to the identity the user was shown. Connection binding is deliberately not added.

```ts
// Step 1 — no token: Core describes the impact and issues a token. Nothing is changed.
{ method: 'sandbox.remove', params: { name: 'atlas-demo-1' } }
→ ok: { confirmation: { token: string, expiresAt: string, action: 'sandbox.remove',
                        target: { name, id }, impact: string[], external: boolean } }

// Step 2 — same params + token: Core re-checks the target identity, then acts.
{ method: 'sandbox.remove', params: { name: 'atlas-demo-1', confirmToken: '…' } }
→ ok: { removed: true }   // no requeried: Core re-queries itself and answers removed only when the confirmed id is gone
```

Token rules:

- 256-bit random, single-use, and expiring after 120 s. Core's `confirmation_ttl` setting can only shorten this (clamped to 120 s).
- Bound to `(action, target identity)`: for a sandbox, its sbx `id` as well as its name, so a same-named replacement is refused with `CONFLICT`.
- Kept in memory only, so tokens die with Core.
- A wrong or expired token gives `VALIDATION_FAILED`, and nothing runs.
- `external: true` (no live Sandpane binding recorded for **this sbx id**; a binding for the same name but another id, or a pre-A1 binding with no recorded id, does not count) is shown prominently by every client.

The same pattern applies to `project.delete`, `conversation.delete` and `worktree` discard.

## 3. Additions, in landing order

Each row is one commit, plus its `docs(audit)` log entry. Status is tracked in the plan file.

| # | Addition | Shape (additive) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | `sandbox.stop` | `{ name }` → `{ stopped: true, requeried?: SandboxSummary }` | `sbx stop N`, then re-query via `ls --json` (02 §5). `requeried` is optional: absent = no longer listed or the re-query failed, so clients show the state as **unknown**. Not destructive, so no token. |
| A1 | `sandbox.remove` | §2 token flow → `{ removed: true }` | `sbx rm --force N` runs only after the token check and the sbx-id re-check. Bindings now record `sbx_id` (schema v4); only the live rows for the confirmed id (plus pre-A1 rows with no id) are captured before `rm` and marked removed, never deleted. A per-sandbox-name Core lock covers `sandbox.create` and the confirmed remove (re-check → binding update); a second operation on the same name gets `CONFLICT` and runs nothing. Residual race (disclosed): `rm` acts on a name, so a same-named sandbox created **out of band** between the re-check and `rm` would be the one removed — sbx v0.47 has no remove-by-id. |
| A1 | `sandbox.start` | **not added** | sbx v0.47.0 has no `start`; restart is the interactive `sbx run --name`. Clients show "Start: not supported by sbx v0.47 (use `sbx run` in a terminal)". |
| A1 | `SandboxCreateSpec.agent?: string` | default `"shell"` (provider-free) | Exact match against the built-in agents in captured `sbx create --help`: `claude, codex, copilot, cursor, devin, docker-agent, droid, gemini, kiro, opencode, shell`. Sandbox **kit references are refused**: local dirs, ZIPs, git repos and OCI refs all run third-party code. `--cloud` is never passed, because it is billable and outside local scope. Provider agents are accepted, but the sandbox is labeled "agent not verified". |
| A2 | `SandboxCreateSpec.idempotencyKey?`, `ConversationSendParams.idempotencyKey?` | string ≤ 128, `[A-Za-z0-9._-]` | Core stores key → result for 24 h. A replay returns the stored result. The same key with different params gives `CONFLICT`. |
| A3 | `project.update` (name, description), `project.archive` / `project.unarchive`, `project.delete` (token), `project.addRepository` / `project.removeRepository` | `Project` gains `description?`, `archivedAt?` | Repositories still pass the canonical git-root + denylist check. Removing a repository is refused while tasks reference it. |
| A3 | `conversation.rename`, `conversation.archive` / `unarchive`, `conversation.delete` (token), `conversation.export` | `Conversation` gains `sandboxId?`, `archivedAt?` | `sandboxId` from create is persisted (it was previously discarded). Export returns redacted JSON within the frame cap, and `truncated` is disclosed. |
| A4 | `ConversationSendParams.mode?: "task" \| "discuss"` | default `"task"` | `discuss` never gets a writable workspace. With no verified adapter, both still answer `PERMISSION_DENIED` (honest). Follow-up from A1: once tasks carry sandbox names, `sandbox.stop` / `sandbox.remove` must refuse, or describe in `impact`, active tasks bound to the sandbox. |
| A5 | `ChangeSet.repoPath?`, `ChangeSet.uninspected?: string[]`, `FileChange.oldPath?` | response fields | `oldPath` comes from `--name-status -M`. `uninspected` lets a future review return a flagged partial list for submodules instead of refusing; today it is always refused. |
| A5 | `git.diff` | `{ taskId, path, maxBytes? }` → `{ path, oldPath?, patch, binary, truncated, baseBlob?, taskBlob? }` | Read-only. Hardened runner; the path must be in the task's change list. Patch capped (default 256 KiB). |
| A6 | `git.apply` (existing) implemented for `selectedFiles` | unchanged shape | Uses `git apply --3way --index`, or `cherry-pick --no-commit` for a whole task. Dirty gate on the touched paths plus the submodule refusal. Conflicts are rolled back and reported as `CONFLICT` with paths. |
| A7 | `verification.list`, `verification.approve` (user-entered argv + label), `verification.revoke`, `verification.run` | `VerificationCommand { id, label, argv: string[], approvedAt }`, `VerificationResult { exitCode, stdout, stderr, truncated, elapsedMs }` | Runs **only** inside the task's sandbox via `sbx exec` with an argv vector (no shell). Output is bounded and redacted. Never runs on the host. |
| A7 | `project.context` | `{ detected: [{ manifest, suggestedCommands: string[][] }], approved: VerificationCommand[] }` | Bounded, read-only manifest parsing. Suggestions are never auto-approved. |
| A8 | `sbx.status` (read-only diagnostics) | `{ path, version, daemon: { running }, policyInitialized?, captured: boolean }` | From `version` and `daemon status --json`. |
| A8 | `sandbox.ports.list`, `sandbox.ports.publish` (loopback only) / `unpublish` | — | Each is advertised only if captured `--help` proves the flags. Otherwise it is not advertised. |
| A8 | policy / templates / MCP / secrets | **read-only listings only** (secrets: names and presence, never values) | Mutating policy, secrets or MCP changes machine-wide settings. They are not exposed in this pass and are recorded as UNVERIFIED and unsupported in the UI. |
| A9 | `maintenance.cleanup` | `{ dryRun: boolean }` → `{ removable: […], removed: […] }` | Retention for worktrees, artifacts and pruned events. Dry-run is the default. |

**Not in v1 additions** (recorded as follow-ups):

- server-push subscription (frames stay request/response; clients poll `task.subscribe`);
- attachment storage and the selection grammar;
- workflow execution (P10 schema skeleton only).

## 4. Client obligations per addition

Every client gets, for each addition:

- typed wrappers;
- gating on advertisement;
- for destructive actions, the two-step token flow surfaced as a native confirmation that shows `impact` and `external`;
- honest unsupported states, such as `sandbox.start` and mutating policy or secrets;
- updated drift tests.

JetBrains and desktop must have landed their enum-tolerance changes before **any** later change adds an enum value (none is planned here).
